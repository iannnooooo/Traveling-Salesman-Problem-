This function generates all possible combinations of bunnies, permutes them to find different orders, and calculates the time required for each path. It then returns the bunny indices of the path that fits within the time limit and has the maximum number of bunnies. If multiple sets of bunnies have the same size, it returns the one with the lowest worker IDs in sorted order.
